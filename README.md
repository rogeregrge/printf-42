# üó£Ô∏è About

The printf function is one of the most versatile and well-known functions in the C language. From a testing aid to tabulation method, printf is a very powerful and important tool in every dev's kit. This project aims to recreate the behaviour of the original MacOS's printf, including its basic error management.

All functions are created in accordance with Norm - the bunch of rules how code should be formatted.

**NOTE!** <br />
Because of 42 School norm requirements: <br />

- All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function <br />
- Each function can't have more then 25 lines of code <br />
- C++ style code commenting is forbidden <br />
- Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating. <br />

<h3>
General requirements from mandatory task
</h3>

> <i>You have to mimic the original printf and manage the following conversions:
>
> - `%c` print a single character.
> - `%s` print a string of characters.
> - `%p` The void \* pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
> - `%d` print a decimal (base 10) number.
> - `%i` print an integer in base 10.
> - `%u` print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
> - `%x` print a number in hexadecimal (base 16).
> - `%%` print a percent sign.</i>
